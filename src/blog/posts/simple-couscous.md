So... this is a quick **couscous** recipe that I make when I forget to prepare something better to take to lunch at work.

## Notes

As normally, I'll keep instructions as simple as possible. Improvise as needed!

## Ingredients

> Couscous

> Salt

> Vegetable or Chicken broth (OPTIONAL)

> Lemon juice (OPTIONAL)

> Seasoning (OPTIONAL)

## Instructions

Put the amount of **couscous** you want in a bowl.

Boil enough **water** to cover the couscous in the bowl. Add some **salt** to it as well.

> If you're putting in the **broth** add it to the water.

Once boiling, add the water until it **reaches the top** of the couscous.

Cover the bowl with a plate and leave it for **5 to 10 minutes**.

Remove the plate. Add a little bit of **lemon** juice üçã and **seasoning** as desired.

Fluff the couscous with a **fork**.

## Suggested consumption

Use it to complement any protein you want. The [Creamy Paprika Chicken](/blog/posts/paprika-chicken) is a good option.
