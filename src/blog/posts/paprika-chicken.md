Devs have to eat too.

This is my first recipe post. I'm sorry to my vegan readers but this will be a recipe for a soft and tasty chicken breasts with cream and paprika, as the title so cleverly implies.

## Notes

I'll keep instructions as simple as possible. This means that even measurements will be ommited very often.

**Let's do this!**

## Ingredients

> Chicken breasts

> Cooking/Heavy cream (35% fat)

> Paprika (Curry would do as well)

> Salt

> Vegetable oil (olive, canola, or anything really)

> Fresh spinach leaves (OPTIONAL)

     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

## Instructions

Cut the **chicken** into cubes.

Mix the chicken with a little bit of **oil** in a frying pan, on **low heat** for 3 minutes or so.

Sprinkle **paprika** and **salt** to taste and mix until the whole chicken is covered.

Add **cooking cream** in the pan. Enough to cover every piece of chicken after you mix the pan contents. Don't add too much to make the chickens swim, though.

> Chickens can't swim. 🏊

Increase heat 🔥 to around 50%.

Add some spinach leaves if you want to.

Mix from time to time for about 10 minutes. Cut one of the pieces to make sure it's not raw.

## Suggested consumption

Having it with some [simple couscous](/blog/posts/simple-couscous) or rice for extra deliciousness.

**Enjoy!!**
